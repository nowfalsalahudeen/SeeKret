App Root
=========

Our app is based here. The rest are libraries. You may want to note the following items:


SOURCE
------
Here you can find the sources of the app in /src.

PROGUARD
------
proguard-rules.pro is the project-specific proguard rules. This helps to slim down the app in attempt to reduce internal storage usage and download bandwidth.

**You are encouraged to skip into [src/main/java]**
